Hello, in this project i will be showing off my HTML and CSS skills with a focus in flex-box.
    It should be quite the improvement from my last project.
OK. so i was having a very hard time with flexbox, i went back and researched some more and found that i was using way too many divs. i cleaned up my HTML and in turn that simplified my css. the 2 files are my updated ones.
